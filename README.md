# Python-and-JS-Dataset-Analysis

Analysis of used cars dataset using python, java script and Mongo DB.

This project aims to combine and analyze two public datasets.

# Data

 The datasets were obtained from the following sources:
 
•	Kaggle: Used Cars Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data

•	Kaggle: California Cities Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/california-housing-feature-engineering

The original vehicles file obtained from the Kaggle: Used Cars Dataset was modified according to the following:

• Only vehicles that use gas as a fuel type were included in the file.

• Only Vehicles from 2018 forward.

# Mongo Db and Node.js

The "BAN-707-CarInsertScript-Mtz-999.py" file was used to obtain the "car2.js" java script file to be able to upload the car data to the Mongo DB database. 

The "BAN-707-createCityInsertScript-Mtz-999.py" file was used to obtain the "CityData2.js java script file to be able to upload the city data to the Mongo DB database.
